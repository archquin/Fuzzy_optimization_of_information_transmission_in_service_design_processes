---

GDFCM stands for gradient descent fuzzy cognition multiplex, and it is a holistic approach to analyze and optimize service design processes. The idea is to determine which *new* data points are relevant for the processes and to what degree; to do so, one needs to define metrics and use the input data for which these metrics are applied. This way, a deductive net is constructed that measures the processes' contribution as well as the services' expenses in a way that the design process has defined. However, there is no new data in this construct as it is strictly supervised and it is meant to determine the constituent process activation at each node; that is achievable by a simple FCM to. Moreover, a tensor is formed with **deep node** interactions which are then used to create process layers for trait/metric activation. Finally, it is possible to deduce whether a new data point fits in the model, to what degree, and for which layer; that is according to inputs and the output is the solution of a process design function, according to metrics.
